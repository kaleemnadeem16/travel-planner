# Multi-Agent System Architecture

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for the Travel Planner's multi-agent AI architecture, designed to break down complex travel planning into specialized, manageable components.

## 🎯 Agent System Overview

The Travel Planner uses a **multi-agent orchestration system** where a central orchestrator delegates specialized tasks to domain-specific agents. This approach provides:

- **Reduced Token Costs**: Smaller, focused contexts for each agent
- **Better Accuracy**: Specialized agents with domain expertise
- **Modularity**: Independent agent updates and modifications
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new agent types
- **User Control**: Granular modification of specific trip components

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
Each agent handles a specific domain with clear boundaries:
- **Planning Agent**: High-level trip structure
- **Location Agent**: Geographic and destination analysis
- **Transport Agent**: Flight, train, car rental coordination
- **Accommodation Agent**: Hotel and lodging selection
- **Activity Agent**: Attractions, restaurants, experiences
- **Budget Agent**: Cost optimization and tracking
- **Weather Agent**: Climate data and recommendations

### 2. **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**
```
User Request → Master Orchestrator → Domain Agents → Specialized Sub-agents
```

### 3. **Context Optimization**
- **Minimal Context**: Each agent receives only relevant information
- **Shared Context**: Common data accessible to all agents
- **Dynamic Loading**: Context loaded on-demand based on task requirements

### 4. **State Management**
- **Immutable State**: Agents work with immutable data structures
- **Event Sourcing**: All changes tracked as events
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy reversion of specific agent outputs

## 🔄 Agent Workflow Example

### Simple Trip Request: "5-day trip to Japan"
```
1. Master Orchestrator receives request
2. Planning Agent creates trip structure
3. Location Agent analyzes Japan destinations  
4. Weather Agent fetches forecast data
5. Transport Agent finds flights
6. Accommodation Agent suggests hotels
7. Activity Agent curates experiences
8. Budget Agent optimizes costs
9. Master Orchestrator assembles final plan
```

### Complex Trip Request: "Visit Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka with must-visit temples"
```
1. Master Orchestrator parses complex requirements
2. Planning Agent creates multi-city structure
3. Location Agent analyzes each city + transportation between
4. Activity Agent specifically searches for temples
5. Transport Agent coordinates inter-city travel
6. Accommodation Agent optimizes locations for temple access
7. Budget Agent balances costs across cities
8. Master Orchestrator resolves conflicts and assembles plan
```

## 🎨 User Interface Integration

### Graph-Based Trip Visualization
The frontend will display the trip as an interactive graph where:
- **Nodes**: Represent trip components (flights, hotels, activities)
- **Edges**: Show dependencies and relationships
- **Colors**: Indicate agent responsible for each component
- **Interactive**: Users can click nodes to modify specific elements

### Component Modification Flow
```
User clicks Hotel Node → Hotel Agent activated → New options presented → 
User selects → Budget Agent recalculates → UI updates affected components
```
