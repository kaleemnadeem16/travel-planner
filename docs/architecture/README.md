## 🎯 Key Architecture Concepts

### System Architecture Style
- **Pattern**: Client-Server with RESTful APIs
- **Deployment**: Containerized microservices (optional monolith start)
- **Data Flow**: Request-Response with event-driven components
- **Security**: Token-based authentication with role-based authorization

### Core Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, API, and data layers
2. **Modularity**: Loosely coupled components with well-defined interfaces
3. **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling and performance
4. **Security**: Security-first approach with defense in depth
5. **Maintainability**: Clean code, comprehensive testing, and documentation

### Technology Stack Summary

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript | User interface and client-side logic |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, LangGraph, Python | API services and multi-agent orchestration |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL, Qdrant | Primary data storage and vector search |
| **Cache** | Redis | Session storage and caching |
| **Proxy** | Nginx | Load balancing and SSL termination |
| **Container** | Docker | Application packaging and deployment |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For New Developers
1. Read [01-overview.md](./01-overview.md) to understand the system
2. Follow [02-development-setup.md](./02-development-setup.md) to set up your environment
3. Review [03-system-components.md](./03-system-components.md) to understand component relationships
4. Check [04-decisions.md](./04-decisions.md) for context on technical choices

### For Architects and Leads
1. Review all architecture documents for comprehensive understanding
2. Contribute to [04-decisions.md](./04-decisions.md) when making technical decisions
3. Update [05-scalability.md](./05-scalability.md) as the system evolves
4. Maintain [06-contributing.md](./06-contributing.md) guidelines
